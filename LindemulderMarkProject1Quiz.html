Goals: I intend for this to run a ten question quiz with some manor of scoring that outputs a result in the form of a number to the user. Core quiz funtionality will be run from internal javascript. 
Questions can be loaded from a JSON file and extra code can be loaded from .js files referenced in that JSON.
